## The Beginning
I first started learning the clarinet when I was 7 after attending a wonderful performance by a Naval band at the Music of the Night at the dockyards in Plymouth.
There was a clarinet solo halfway through that just spoke to me.
It was a mesmerising piece that for the life of me I cannot remember how it sounds, but I remember how it was uplifting and just made me feel incredible.
I started lessons the next term of school using my Grandad's old clarinet.

## The old clarinet
### The clarinet itself
The clarinet was an old Vandoran clarinet that was probably just new enough to be plastic but was from probably the 40s or 50s. It had a beautiful sound and was a genuine joy to play.

### The early years
I used this clarinet from my first lesson all the way up to my Grade 3. It was in excellent condition and other than occasionally needing to change the pads it never needed maintenance or work.
The clarinet was way above beginner grade, not that it was bad for a beginner, but I don't think I was ever able to truly get the best sound out of it.

### Wind band and Orchestra
At my prep school I was able to take part in a wind band (which was mostly clarinets) and the full school orchestra which were both a lot of fun.
The wind band played mostly jazz and the orchestra mostly classical pieces, so it was always something new to play and different enough not to get dull.

### The crime!
In my school if you were a boarder and learning an instrument your 30-minute daily practice was most likely just before or just after breakfast.
This was because we were all young children and without parental supervision or an enforced practice time we probably wouldn't have done it.
My practice time was 0715 to 0745 Monday to Friday. I cant imagine this nowadays because firstly I have insomnia so getting up at that time every day is a bad joke, and secondly I have neighbours that I like.

One day I came down to practice, collected my clarinet from the storage area and went into my assigned practice room.
Upon opening the case I only felt horror and dismay as someone had smashed all the keys of the clarinet and there was no way it could be played and seemed like it would be impossible to ever play again (more on this later).

### Parents to the rescue
The school probably knew who it was, it wasn't the first time the clarinet had been sabotaged (once before the school music competition someone had cut all the cork off the different sections (Bastard!)).
However it was the kind of school where the wealthier or more connected the parents were the more likely the school was to side with them so nothing ever got done about it.
My parent seeing how sad I was that I was unable to continue learning decided to buy me my own new clarinet.

## The new clarinet
### The search
We spent a long time talking with my clarinet teacher and getting advice from other players about what clarinet to try and ended up deciding on a Buffet E11 (with a Vandoran b45 mouthpiece).

That was the first problem, second was finding somewhere that sold one. This was in a time before my parents would even consider buying something online and there were no stores anywhere near where I lived that sold it.
Fortunately our neighbors knew of a great mail order / phone order music company that would let you try an instrument for a month and then return it if it was unsuitable, so we ordered it from there.

### Arrival
One of the hardest items I ever remember having to wait for and when it finally did I barely moistened the reed before playing nonstop for hours.
I was so happy and fell in love with the instrument immediately and threw myself back into my lessons.

## Lessons
In my lessons I continued taking ABRSM exams until I had completed grade 4 and as I was playing with my teacher he asked me a question that changed how I looked at my clarinet playing.
He asked me "why are you playing, what do you want to get out of it?" and I struggled to answer, my first thought was music grades, but I quickly realised that these meant nothing to me and all I wanted to do was jam.

My lessons transitioned from playing pieces that I didn't really care for to pieces that I wanted to play and to just playing jazz in a more freestyle way. He was probably my favourite teacher for anything I ever learned.

## Retirement
Sadly my teacher decided to retire, I have no idea how old he was, but he once joked about playing on the Ark so probably pretty old.
I was sad to see him go as a teacher, but we had a great last few lessons and I wished him well in his retirement. It took a couple of months for the school to line up and new teacher and I honestly now wish they hadn't.

## The End?
### Enter the new teacher
The new teacher like my first one was ex-military, but he was a very no nonsense, no fun, zero sense of humor kind of person.
In our first lesson he said I needed to do grades and that because we hadn't been covering the recommended course scales that we would be focussing on only scales for the next few months.

Needless to say we got along like nitroglycerin and a paint mixer. He was a terrible teacher, and I say that objectively looking back now that I am a trained coach.
He spent whole lessons telling me why I was terrible and should listen to him if I wanted to get my grade 5 or higher (I was playing around grade 6/7 standard at this point) instead of actually teaching me anything.
It was a lot of little things as well, like making me move to the other side of the music stand because the sun was reflecting off the sheet music, and he couldn't read it (I don't know if he thought I had built in sunglasses or something).

### Secondary school orchestra
My secondary school orchestra was run by the music teacher, and he didn't pick the most inspiring pieces to play. 
The clarinets never had the melody or any leading parts to play, so I quickly got bored here, not because I was not in the spotlight but because the clarinet parts were dull and uninspiring.
I decided to quit the orchestra when the music teachers daughter who was grade 2 was promoted to first chair even though she couldn't play the pieces and did not want to be first chair.
Even though I hadn't been enjoying it I was really annoyed with the situation, and it left me feeling tired of playing something that had brought be so much joy.

### The decision
Not long after quiting the orchestra I realised that I was not playing the clarinet anymore, I was performing a chore.
I never practiced and when I did play it there was not fun, no wonder, no feeling of freedom like when I used to jam with my old teacher.
With a heavy heart I stopped my clarinet lessons and put it away saying that I would try again in a few years. Those few years never turned out to be a lot longer that I ever thought they would be.
